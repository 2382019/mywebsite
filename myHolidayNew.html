            <h2>Hello There!</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is <b>Gisella Mercy Waworuntu</b>. I want to tell you about my summer break this semester. 
            These past three months I came back to my house in Bogor. It was so lovely to be back and reunited with my 
            parents, my annoying brother, and my dogs. I could finally enjoy my mother's delicious and comforting cooking. 
            I could play with my dogs all the time, hang out with my high school friends, and just stay at home watching 
            dramas until I got bored.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this holiday, I spent most of my time with my church friends, whom you can see in the picture above. 
            We participated in many events together. We ate durian after church, served God together, ran together multiple times, 
            spent our Sunday playing futsal and cooking, and bid farewell to one of my friends who was leaving for the USA 
            due to his father's work. One particularly memorable event was our church retreat in Puncak, Bogor, which lasted for three days, 
            starting on May 31st and ending on June 2nd. We played a lot of fun games. On Saturday night, we enjoyed a <i>shabu-shabu</i> and <i>barbeque</i>
            dinner. We talked about everything and random things until 3 PM. We also played sports like table tennis, badminton, and swimming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I'm really grateful and happy for this holiday or summer break. There were a lot of things and situations 
            that happened that I could never have imagined before. It wasn't always that happy and joyful there were still tears 
            and sadness. But I'm glad I could spend my holiday with my beloved people.
            </p>
